## This program is built by applying basic Data structures

- Linked lists⛓️ 
- Doubly linked lists⛓️ ⛓️ 
- Queues🫶 

## It has features like

- Creating a playlist

## Implementation
- Playlist: The data structure of choice for modelling a playlist would be a doubly linked list. This would come in handy as new songs can be added or the old ones can be removed from the playlist at any point in a doubly linked list.It supports playing(querying) the previous song, next song and (current + i)’th song on the playlist
- Play Queue: A queue abstract data-type to follow FIFO. The choice of implementation of the ADT can be either a linked list or an array.
